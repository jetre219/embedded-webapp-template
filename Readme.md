# Telephony WS

## What
This is a template for creating a Web REST API using Java, Jetty, Jersey only.

## Context
This is a structure that does not depend on Dependency Injection and instead rely on managing the creation of the 
project. This is a small, but complete, software stack to be used as a start point for a University project. Test 
coverage is minimal to encourage students to explore how to test. The exercise is to understand how everything works
 together before using Dependency Injection frameworks.

## How to run
* If Java and Maven are installed and your JAVA_HOME is set, execute `mvn compile` then `mvn exec:java`
* In an IDE, run as a Java Application the class `TelephonyWsMain`
